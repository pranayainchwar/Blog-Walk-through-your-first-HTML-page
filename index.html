        HTML, is short for Hyper Text Markup Language Basically, it's the "code"
        behind every webpage- even this one. If you're just beginning to learn
        HTML.let us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without
        styling. can't do anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table,
        or creating frames- but it is handy as it helps you structure the
        content correctly, which is important when you sit down to add style to
        your HTML

        However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
        to full-fledged web development. Various tools easily estimate the HTML
        coding from your work process- but if you want to be in full control of
        your web-page, you'll need to have some commands over HTML.
      </h6>
      <h6>
        Through this artical, we aimn to give you essential HTML building block
        that'll help you get up and running. Reading this, you'll be able to
        understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!

      <h4>Step One - TAGS</h4>
      <img
        src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png"
        alt="tag"
      />
      <h6>
        Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code.
        A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on yourvHTML
        document. Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by
        them.
      </h6>
      <h6>Let's look at two type of tags:</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>
          &gt tag-example-1 &gt I need a closign tag &lt tag-example-1 &gt
        </li>
        <li>
          &gt tag-example-2/&gt I don't need a cloding tag &gt tag-example-1 &gt
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h6>
        In the first example, the sentence is wrappred by two tags. The fist one
        is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag.
        Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
        commonly used examples of such tags are &lt html &gt, &lt head &gt, &lt
        body &gt, &lt strong &gt etc.
      </h6>
      <h6>
        The second example tags about loner tags- as in, they don't need a
        closing tag to function. Although it's not required, these type of tags
        are often written as &lt tag &gt to make the debugging of code easier.
        Common example of such tags are &lt hr/ &gt -used for horizontal line,
        &lt br/ &gt- to break the line, etc.
      </h6>

    <h4>Step three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h4>
    <div>
      <img
        src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg"
        alt="headbody"
      />
      <h6>
        These tags are essential for any HTML document.They parcel out the
        significant parts of your HTML code.
      </h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &lt BODY &gt &lt/ BODY &gt is placed below your &lt HEAD &gt, and
          everything that you want to be displayed on your screen comes under
          this tag. Text, images, links, and pretty much anything you can see in
          your browser live inside this tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt HTML &g &lt/ HTML &gtt wraps your entire code. Everything else in
          your HTML document needs to come inside these tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt HTML &gt &lt/ HTML &gt includes things like litle, styles, and
          script.Head is usually present at the top (hah!).just inside the &lt/
          HTML &gt tag.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>step three- A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h4>
      <h6>
        Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let's
        process with the things that will go inside your &lt BODY &gt and do
        so,e magic!
      </h6>
      <ul>
        <h6>Some basic text formatting tags:</h6>
        <li>&lt b &gt &lt/ b &gt makes your text look <b> bold</b></li>
        <li>&lt i &gt &lt/ i &gt makes you write in <i>cursive</i></li>
        <li>&lt u &gt &lt/ u &gt <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>For example, this piece of code</h6>
      <hr />
      <h6>&lt html &gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt head &gt &lt/ head &gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt body &gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt i &gt I am italics! &lt/ i &gt &lt br/ &gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt b &gt I am bold! &lt/ b &gt &lt br /&gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt u &gt And me, well, I'm underlined! &lt/ u &gt &lt br /&gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt/ body &gt</h6>
      <h6>&lt/ html &gt</h6>
      <hr />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h6>
        Should produce something like this on your browser: Don't fret too much
        about the &lt br /&gt. It's just for breaking the line so that you can
        start from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to
        changing lines in your HTML document.
      </h6>
      <img
        src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001490.png"
        alt="searchbar"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Tags to help you structure your content:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          &lt/ br &gt break the line, making you continue to the next line
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt/ p &gt stands for paragraph. It divides your content into
          paragraphs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h6>
        Note: You need to use these tags as space and enter keys do very little
        when it comes to formatting content inside an HTML document.
      </h6>
      <h5>Heading Tags:</h5>
      <h6>
        HTML provides you with six tags, from &lt H1 &gt &lt/ H1 &gt to &lt H6
        &gt &lt/ H6 &gt to help you create diffrent sized headers quickly.
      </h6>
      <img
        src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png"
        alt="h1 to h6 tags"
      />
      <h5>Inserting an Image:</h5>
      <h6>
        All that's good, but what fun without images on webpages? Don't worry,
        &lt IMG /&gt to the recuse! The image tag has a mandetory attributes
        called "scouce". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look
        for the image. The syntax goes something like:
      </h6>
      <h6>&lt img src = "path_to_your_image"/ &gt</h6>
      <h6>
        Furthermore, it also has attributes like height and width that let you
        specify the height and width you want your image to take.
      </h6>
      <h5>List:</h5>
      <h6>
        HTML has two types of lists- ordered list and unordered list. Each item
        of your list has to be enclosed in tag. The syntax for creating a list
        is fairly simple
      </h6>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <h6>Suppose you want yo create a list like:</h6>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>The following code will easily do the job for you:</h6>
    <hr />
    <h6>&lt ul &gt</h6>
    <h6>&lt li &gt Item 1 &lt/ li &gt</h6>
    <h6>&lt li &gt Item 2 &lt/ li &gt</h6>
    <h6>&lt li &gt Item 3 &lt/ li &gt</h6>
    <h6>&lt/ ul &gt</h6>
    <hr />
    <hr />
    <div>
      <img
        src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001489.png"
        alt="list items"
      />
      <h6>
        All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide with a simple
        webpage consisting of images, headings, and lists. Further, there are
        Various tags that HTML support, and we thoroughly recommend you to check
        them out and play with them !
      </h6>

      <h4>In Conclusion</h4>
      <h6>
        You now know enough to skim through and understand any part of an HTML
        code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source
        code of any website (you'll find some tags you don't know, but that's
        how you learn!). Oh, and welcome to the world of web development. With
        HTML under your belt, ypur belt, your next stop should be making your
        page look beutiful using CSS
